## Philosophy: Everything is a Tag

Taggy Todo is built on a simple yet powerful concept: **everything is a tag**. 

Traditional task management apps use rigid structures like lists, boards, or complex hierarchies. Taggy Todo breaks free from these constraints by reimagining the entire user interface as a collection of dynamic, colorful tags.

Each tag represents not just a category, but a potential filter, status indicator, or visual organizer. The power is in the simplicity - tags can be dragged, filtered, colored, and even given background images to create a visual language that works for _your_ unique way of thinking.

## Key Features

- **100% Free and Local**: Your data stays on your computer in a local SQLite database
- **No Accounts Required**: No sign-ups, subscriptions, or cloud dependencies
- **Tag-Based Organization**: Create unlimited tags with custom colors
- **Visual Task Management**: Tasks appear as bubbles that can be tagged, filtered and organized
- **Rich Media Support**: Drag and drop images and PDFs directly into tasks
- **Customizable Interface**: Toggle between list and grid views, customize fonts, and choose light or dark mode
- **Drag-and-Drop Workflow**: Intuitive interface for applying tags and managing tasks
- **Powerful Filtering**: Instantly filter tasks by multiple tags

1. Download the application (no installation required)
2. Run `python todo.py`

## Why Taggy Todo?

- **Flexible Organization**: Break free from rigid organizational systems
- **Visual Thinking**: Use colors and spatial organization that matches your mental model
- **Zero Learning Curve**: Intuitive interface that anyone can use immediately

## What Makes It Unique

Taggy Todo stands apart from typical task management apps. While most productivity tools use tags as a secondary feature, Taggy Todo makes tags the central organizing principle. You won't find many applications that:

- Allow tags to become the primary visual interface
- Let you create a personal visual language through colored, draggable tags
- Support attaching background images to tags to transform your workspace
- Combine rich media support with a tag-first approach
- Remain completely local and free from cloud dependencies

This unique approach creates a more organic, intuitive way to organize information that adapts to your thinking style rather than forcing you into predefined structures.
