## Philosophy

Taggy Todo is built on the innovative concept that "everything is a tag" - a core principle derived from the Subjective Technologies framework. This approach is part of the patent-pending Subjective Knowledge Hooks technology (USPTO Application: [US20220358283A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20220358283A1/en)).

The tag-centric philosophy allows for:
- Flexible organization of tasks
- Dynamic relationships between different items
- Intuitive categorization
- Seamless task management
