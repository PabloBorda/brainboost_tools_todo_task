# Taggy Todo

A free, standalone task management application with a unique tag-centric interface.

## Philosophy: Everything is a Tag

Taggy Todo is built on a simple yet powerful concept: **everything is a tag**. 

Traditional task management apps use rigid structures like lists, boards, or complex hierarchies. Taggy Todo breaks free from these constraints by reimagining the entire user interface as a collection of dynamic, colorful tags.

Each tag represents not just a category, but a potential filter, status indicator, or visual organizer. The power is in the simplicity - tags can be dragged, filtered, colored, and even given background images to create a visual language that works for _your_ unique way of thinking.
